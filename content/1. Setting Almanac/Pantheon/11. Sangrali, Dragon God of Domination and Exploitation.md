Lawful Evil

Patron of the Draconic Cult, Sangrali urges his followers to dominate and exploit in his name. His worship is generally prohibited outside the Dominion of Sun and Moon, and his followers are not well received. 

He holds a profound respect for the order of the world. To dominate and exploit means to impose rules on others, and in so doing, one must respect the rules the world places on himself.
