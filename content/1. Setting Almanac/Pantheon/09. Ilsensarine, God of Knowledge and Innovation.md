Chaotic Good

Illsensarine is one of the most favorable Gods toward mankind. His blessings manifest in the form of highly enhanced intellect and bouts of eureka. He enjoys seeing mankind prosper and innovate, and is always eager to see what they will invent next. He conflicts with the more restrictive deities, as he views freedom as a necessary device for innovation.
