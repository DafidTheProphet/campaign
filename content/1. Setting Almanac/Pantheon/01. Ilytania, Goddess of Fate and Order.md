Lawful Good

Ilytania, Goddess of Fate and Order, oversees the destiny of the world and those within it. She played a major role in the creation of the universe, establishing the orderly principles that govern natural phenomena. 

Among the other Gods and Goddesses, she is one of the most generous with blessings. Those she blesses are known as the Augurs, individuals with the gift of prophecy. Each Augur has a unique manifestation of their gift. Some receive their visions during certain hours of the day, or see prophecies in reflective surfaces. Some may see the visions in the same manner, but the potency of their ability is different. Most Augurs are recruited by the Tsugeh as soon as their ability manifests. 

The center of Ilytania's worshippers lies in Rhankiin, the capitol of Vhiarlat.
