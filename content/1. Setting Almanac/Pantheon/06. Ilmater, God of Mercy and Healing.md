"You have heard that it was said, ‘An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.’ But I say to you, Do not resist one who is evil. But if any one strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also; 40 and if any one would sue you and take your coat, let him have your cloak as well" - Matthew 5:39-40

Ilmater is the most beloved and worshipped god on the Jetztaran continent. In almost every settlement, save for those in the Dominion of Sun and Moon, you can find a church of Ilmater. Most, if not all individuals, dedicate a portion of their worship to him. Their followers provide healing and alms to those most in need, funded by a large number of generous donors.
