Chaotic Evil

Chialo's portfolio is broad and unclear, but it can be best described as the antithesis of civilization. He causes storms that destroy villages, earthquakes that ravage cities, and eruptions that raze the terrain. He is not a friend to humanity. Rather, he seeks to bring them back to the animals they once were, roaming the continent as hunter-gatherers. Each city that still stands is a painful reminder of his failure.
