 The empire's name comes from the color of the mountains as the sun rises. The people of this land live a peaceful and quiet life. Since Haoran Yun-Kai rose to power, the Violet Mountain Empire has never been invaded, as no living cultivator dares to oppose him. Despite his overwhelming power, he does not interfere with affairs outside his domain. Conversely, outsiders, especially cultivators, are rarely welcome in the Violet Mountain Empire. Visitors are only welcomed in the port of Moh-Jong, located along the Southwestern coast of the empire.
