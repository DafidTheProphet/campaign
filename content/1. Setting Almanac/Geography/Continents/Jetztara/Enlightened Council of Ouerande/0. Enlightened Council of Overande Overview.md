Nestled in a diverse landscape that stretches from grassy plains to frigid tundras, the Enlightened Council of Overande is a land of striking natural contrasts. The country's southern and central regions are characterized by rolling hills and slightly tropical climates, where the lush greenery is nourished by numerous rivers winding through the terrain. These rivers converge in the heart of Overande, creating vast marshes and swamps that are both treacherous and teeming with life. Moving northward, the land gradually ascends into a formidable mountain range, where the air grows colder, and the terrain shifts to a harsh tundra.

The governance of Overande is as unique as its geography. The country is ruled by a council of elders, a coalition of the most revered and influential members of the Adamantine Fist Sect and the Guiding Palm Sect.  Despite the philosophical schism between the two groups, the nation as a whole is united. 

Despite its natural beauty and spiritual depth, Overande is the weakest economically among its neighboring nations. However, it is far from destitute. The people of Overande have cultivated a society that values communal effort and the collective good over individual wealth. The government operates on principles that encourage shared responsibility and mutual support, ensuring that resources, though limited, are distributed fairly across the populace. This approach has fostered a strong sense of unity and purpose among the citizens, who take pride in their unique way of life.

In Overande, prosperity is measured not by the wealth of individuals but by the strength of the community and the spiritual enlightenment of its people. The country's leadership strives to maintain this balance, guiding Overande through the challenges of economic hardship with the same resolve and wisdom that has sustained them for generations.
