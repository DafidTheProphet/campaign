In the skies of **Jetztara**, a plethora of islands float among the clouds. They were formed when remnants of the old volcano **Mereth-Mar** coalesced around large sources of magical energy. Their sizes can vary from as large as a city to the size of a cottage. Some islands meander through the sky just over the continent. Others are static, rooted to one place. Intrigued by the archipelago from the day they arrived, the **Jetztarans** soon settled in the clouds as they advanced in science and magic.
