The Free Isle of Aenwidia lies on the largest island in the Archipelago of Mereth-Mar. Roaming around the continent, it was the first island on which the Jetztarans settled. The clans, kingdoms, and confederations of the Jetztara sent their brightest individuals to establish a city atop the island. With their combined expertise, they constructed an unrivaled city, filled with technological wonders. Completely self-governed, it is the most prosperous city on the Jetztaran continent. The conflicts between the countries that sent them let the builders of Aenwidia separate, using their economic power as leverage. It is the center of all commerce, diplomacy, and technological research. Large airships dock at the edges of the island, ferrying cargo and passengers to the surface and other floating islands.
