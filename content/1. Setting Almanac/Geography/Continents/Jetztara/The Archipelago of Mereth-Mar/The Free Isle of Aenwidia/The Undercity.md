The Undercity houses the numerous machines and facilities needed to keep the city running. 

Closest to the surface lies a complex sewer and water main system. The sewer system leads to a wastewater treatment plant, where the resulting liquid can be used for the multistory gardening complexes aboveground. The city siphons its drinking water from natural sources on the ground, mainly from the central Merethian Sea, the large crater lake within the ancient mountain. It uses a system of linked portals to transfer the water from the source to the treatment plant. 

Below the sewer system, lies the headquarters of the helmsmen's guild. They are responsible for steering the island to its designated location. 

Immediately below the sewers lie the low-waste industrial facilities, where lower scale manufacturing is performed. The lack of open air restricts the industrial processes that can be performed here. Between the factories, shops and restaurants located around a central square cater to the workers. 

The very bottom of the island is forbidden to civilians. Only members of the Aenwidian defense force are allowed through this point.
