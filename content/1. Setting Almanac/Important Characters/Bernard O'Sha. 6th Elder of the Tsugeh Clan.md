As the youngest Tsugeh elder in history, he has a bright future. At the age of 30, he has already reached the core formation stage, and can cast 8th level spells. He oversees international relations between Vhiarlat and the rest of the continent. Currently, he is stationed in Aenwidia, where he works with other martial envoys and the Preservation Alliance. As the son of the current clan head, he feels a great sense of responsibility. As a result, he feels personally responsible when his country does wrong unto others. After hearing of the events that took place in Naviej, he has taken it upon himself to make amends.
