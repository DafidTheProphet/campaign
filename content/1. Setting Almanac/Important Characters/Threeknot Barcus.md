Barcus is a middling member of the vagabond guild tasked managing the party during their tenure as Wayfarers. He fumbled the bag during the initial stages of their job, but now he is working to bring them up to speed. Regaining his sense of duty, he organized an intensive training camp to bring the party up to speed. He aspires to become a fiveknot elder, the highest rank in the Vagabond Union. Currently, he is a threeknot, which indicates his cultivation level (foundation establishment), and his rank within the union.
