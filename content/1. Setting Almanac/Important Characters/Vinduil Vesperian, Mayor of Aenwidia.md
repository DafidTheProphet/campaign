Born in Rhankiin, the capital of Vhiarlat, Vinduil was once a member of the Tsugeh clan. He was once a genius diviner, but unfortunately suffered a serious accident during a instructional bout, crippling his cultivation. 5 years later, he enrolled in Aenwidian University, becoming an archmage, and earning his doctorate in magical technology four years later. His work on zero-point energy production and permanent space expansion garnered significant public praise. Now 30, he has used his public perception to become the mayor of Aenwidia.

As the recently elected Mayor of Aenwidia, Vinduil Vesperian has his work cut out for him. Being the only neutral party, he has to coordinate a continent-wide effort to prevent the apocalypse.
