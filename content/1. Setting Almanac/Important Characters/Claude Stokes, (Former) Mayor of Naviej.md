Once a former prodigy of the Tsugeh Clan, Mayor Stokes had a bright future ahead of him as a high-ranking diviner. His talent for cultivation and divination was exceptional, but he was a subpar wizard. As one must be talented in all three disciplines to advance in the Tsugeh clan, he was quickly cast to the wayside. Seeking to regain some standing, he pioneered the outlandish project that lead to the fiasco in Naviej. 

His prophetic visions are of level 3 potency and are triggered through electrical shocks.
