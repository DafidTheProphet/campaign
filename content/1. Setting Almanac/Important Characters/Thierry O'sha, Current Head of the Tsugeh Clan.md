Thierry O'sha is the current head of the Tsugeh clan and its most powerful member. He is well known for his entrapping magic and elaborate schemes. He is willing to do whatever he must for the sake of his clan and family. Because of previous events, he is not on good terms with the Aenwidian government and the Mereth-Mar sect. 
 
Bernard O'sha, his only son, is the youngest Tsugeh elder in the history of the clan.   

His visions are of level 5 potency, and the trigger is unknown.
