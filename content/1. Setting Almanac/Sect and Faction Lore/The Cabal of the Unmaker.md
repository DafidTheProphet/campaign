This mysterious organization has worked tirelessly to stymie the [[The Murim Alliance]] in their efforts to prevent the apocalypse. Their goals and objectives are largely unknown. From what little we can gather, they seem to believe that the forseen apocalypse does not spell the end of the world. Rather, they believe they are freeing themselves from an enigmatic binding in an event known as the collapse of destiny. 

Regardless of their beliefs, they are surprisingly formidable. They have infiltrated several organizations, and have powerful backers. It would be wise to treat carefully when encountering them.
