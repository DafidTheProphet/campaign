Rulers of the criminal underworld, the Hao clan, they are the only surviving members of the once prominent groups of unorthodox sects. As far as we know, they do not hold any territory like the other major sects, rather, they have establishments within all countries on the continent. The governments detest their presence significantly, but like cockroaches, they can never be truly eradicated. They find their home in casinos, brothels, and smuggling operations, but these are merely fronts for their main industry. 

Like the Vagabond Union, they deal in information. Their difference lies in how they use it. The Hao clan uses their fronts to find information on powerful clients to blackmail them for favors and priviliges. They hope to garner enough influence so that one day, they can rise again, and stand in the open as a proud and powerful sect.
