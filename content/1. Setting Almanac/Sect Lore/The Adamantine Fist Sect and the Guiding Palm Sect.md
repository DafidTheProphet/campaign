The Adamantine Fist Sect and the Guiding Palm Sect are two sides of the same coin. Originally a singular clan formed by the Northern orcs, they split due to a philosophical disagreement. The orcs of the North were known for their primal aggression. One faction of the orcs believed that this aggression must be controlled and suppressed through meditation and inner peace. Another faction believed that their anger must be channeled and released using powerful physical martial arts. The two factions split from each other and became the Guiding Palm, and Adamantine Fist sects respectively. Initially, each sect governed their land independently, but during the Crucible, they realized the need for a unified nation of orcs.
