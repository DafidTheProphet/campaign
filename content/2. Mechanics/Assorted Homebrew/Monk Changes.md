Monk is rather underpowered. To buff this class, we give it heavy synergy with the cultivation system, all the optional features, and a rework of some key features. If a class feature is not mentioned here, assume it is unchanged from the base rules.

## Martial Arts

At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortswords, any simple melee weapons that don't have the special or heavy property, or your dedicated weapon. You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren't wearing armor, wielding a shield, or using the blade song feature:

- You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for athletics checks, and attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons.
- You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.
- You can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action.
- If your monk weapon has a smaller hit die than your martial arts die, you may use your martial arts die instead.

## Stunning Strike

Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of qi in an opponent's body. When you hit another creature with a monk weapon or unarmed strike, you can spend 1 qi point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the start of your next turn. Upon a failure, the target's speed is halved and the next attack made against them is done so with advantage.

## Purity of Body

At 10th level, you are at the peak of physical health. You are immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition.

## Perfect Self

At 20th level, your mastery of qi lets you perform basic techniques effortlessly. Patient defense and step of the wind now cost zero qi to use. Your Dexterity and Wisdom scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24.
