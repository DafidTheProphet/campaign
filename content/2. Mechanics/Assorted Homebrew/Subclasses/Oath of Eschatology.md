This subclass is taken from [this page](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Oath_of_Eschatology_(5e_Subclass)) at the DnD wiki, with some modifications.

Paladins who swear the Oath of the Eschatology are driven by a profound understanding of the impending end times. They dedicate themselves to preserving balance, wielding divine power to bring about justice and protect the world from apocalyptic threats.

## Tenets of Eschatology

Paladins who follow the Oath of the Eschatology adhere to the following tenets:

- **Order**. The destruction of the world originates from a disruption in the fate defined order of the world. Find and eliminate any threats to the natural order of the world.
- **Vigilance**. The apocalypse may come at any moment. Always seek out signs of impending disaster. Never grow idle nor complacent. To do so means total destruction.
- **The Greater Good**. The apocalypse means the end of us all. Stop at nothing to prevent it, even if you must trample on others.

## Channel Divinity

At 3rd level, you gain the following Channel Divinity options:

- **Divine Balance**. You can use your Channel Divinity to restore balance to the battlefield. As an action, you present your holy symbol and choose up to three creatures within 30 feet of you. Each chosen creature must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is affected by either _calm emotions_ or _wrathful smite_ (your choice). The chosen creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.
- **Prophecy's Gaze**. You can use your Channel Divinity to gain insights into the future. As an action, you close your eyes and concentrate for 1 minute, during which you can sense the potential outcomes of events that will occur within the next hour. You gain advantage on your next Wisdom (Perception) check, Wisdom (Insight) check, or Dexterity saving throw before the end of your next turn.

## Aura of Order

Starting at 7th level, your presence emanates an aura of balance that bolsters your allies. You and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you gain resistance to necrotic and fire damage. In addition, you and friendly creatures have advantage against any effect that would forcibly move them.

The aura's range increases to 30 feet at 18th level.

## Eschatological Intervention

At 15th level, you gain the ability to intervene in the course of fate. When you or a creature within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can use your reaction to grant a bonus equal to your Charisma modifier to the roll. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1). You regain all expended uses of this feature after a long rest.

## Avatar of Order

At 20th level, you can assume the form of an embodiment of balance. As an action, you can transform into an Avatar of Balance for 1 minute. While in this form, you gain the following benefits:

- You may substitute the number 12 for a d20 roll on an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw. You must perform this substitution in lieu of rolling the d20. You cannot roll the d20 and substitute later.
- Whenever you deal damage to a creature, you can choose to deal an additional 1d8 cold damage or restore hit points to an ally within 30 feet of you equal to the bonus damage dealt.
- As a bonus action, you can unleash a wave of energy in a 30-foot cone originating from you. Each creature in the cone must make a Constitution saving throw, taking cold damage equal to your paladin level on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
