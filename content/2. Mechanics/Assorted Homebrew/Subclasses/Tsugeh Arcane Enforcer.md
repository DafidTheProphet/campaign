The Tsugeh Arcane Enforcers are highly trained wizards tasked with enacting the will of the Tsugeh. Their strength comes from their unparalleled versatility in combat, switching between melee and magic in a moment's notice. The training methods of Arcane Enforcers are a closely kept secret. Those outside the Tsugeh clan cannot adopt this arcane tradition.

## Intensified Martial Training

Upon completing your initial training as an Arcane Enforcer (reaching 2nd level), you gain proficiency in light armor, simple weapons, and 2 martial weapons of your choice that lack the heavy or two-handed property. In addition, your hit point maximum increases by 2 hit points, and 1 hit point every Arcane Enforcer level thereafter.

## Warmind

Your initial training under this tradition at 2nd level molds your mind to excel at strategizing in the midst of combat. You can employ unorthodox strategies to adapt to the battlefield.

- **Targeted Attack**: The best debuff you can inflict upon an enemy is death. Your battlefield flexibility lets you sacrifice accuracy for damage. When wielding a weapon you are proficient in, you may sacrifice your proficiency bonus to attack rolls and gain a boost to damage equal to double your proficiency bonus. The wielder also suffers an effect that lasts until the start of their next turn. Roll a d6 and consult the table below to determine the effect.
- **Adaptive Focus**: When you are wielding or are attuned to a weapon you are proficient with, you eschew the need for a magical focus. You still satisfy the non-monetary material component requirement for spells you cast.

|d6|Outcome|
|---|---|
|1|-2 Penalty to DEX saves|
|2|-1 Penalty to attack rolls|
|3|+2 to all damage received|
|4|Gain a level of exhaustion|
|5|Roll 2d4 and suffer two of the above effects|
|6|Nothing happens|

## Extra Attack

At 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. Moreover, you can cast one of your cantrips in place of one of those attacks.

## Awakened Trance

At 10th level, you tap into your magical abilities to bolster your melee prowess. You may use a bonus action to enter into a trance for ten minutes. The trance grants you the following:

- You may add your Intelligence modifier to your attack rolls. This bonus increases to double your Intelligence modifier at level 16.
- You gain a +2 bonus to concentration saving throws.
- You gain advantage on ability checks using Intelligence.
- You gain vulnerability to psychic damage.

You may use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain uses of this ability upon a long rest. 

## Two Minds, One Body

At 14th level, your training has fully adapted your mind to the strain of balancing magical and melee combat. While in the awakened trance, you may cast a 5th level spell or lower as a bonus action when you have used your action to make an attack.
