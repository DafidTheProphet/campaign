# New Bonus Actions

As in Baldur's Gate 3, shoving, dipping a weapon, and consuming a potion now take a bonus action instead of an action. If you choose to shove as a bonus action, you may only move them away 5ft, not knock them prone. Taking the shield master feet lets you do both as a bonus action.

# Banned Spells
- Silvery Barbs: It causes too much buffoonery. Imagine if an enemy mage just gave you disadvantage on a whim.

# Tavern Brawler 
Accustomed to the rough-and-tumble fighting using whatever weapons happen to be at hand, you gain the following benefits:

- Increase your Strength or Constitution score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

- You are proficient with improvised weapons.

- Your unarmed strike uses a d4 for damage.

- When you make an unarmed attack, use an improvised weapon, or throw something, your Strength Modifier is added twice to the damage.

- When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike or an improvised weapon on your turn, you can use a bonus action to attempt to grapple the target.

# Initiative

We will use a d10 to roll initiative instead of a d20. This makes building for high initiative more rewarding. 

# Healing Potions
If a potion of healing is used as a bonus action, you roll the dice to determine the amount of HP healed. If you use an action, or take the potion outside of combat, then you are healed for the maximum amount of HP (ex: 2d4+2 --> 10).
