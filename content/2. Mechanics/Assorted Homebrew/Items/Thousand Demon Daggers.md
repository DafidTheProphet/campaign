**Weapon (jian), Artifact (Requires Attunement)**

The Thousand Demon Daggers is a deep blue jian sheathed in an ebony scabbard. It deals 2d4 slashing or 1d8 piercing +3 (19/20 ×2) damage, plus 1d8 slashing/piercing damage. It has a range of 10 ft / 3 m. It automatically critically strikes when attacking an object. This weapon cannot be forcibly taken from the wielder. If the wielder drops the weapon, they can call it to their hand at will.

Forged by the ancient sage Silbrose in the depths of her Arcanaeum, she used the secrets of the **Ancient Race** to craft this weapon as a singular crystal of an adamantium-tungsten alloy. Upon quenching the jian, its blade shattered into a thousand pieces. This egregious misstep turned out to be a blessing in disguise. A master of qi attuned to this weapon can easily manipulate the shards of this blade, disassembling and reforming it at will. Each shard can act as a deadly missile, catching enemies off guard. The blade can disperse and reform around a shield, bypassing it entirely.

This overwhelming offensive power comes at a cost. This weapon cannot be used for any defensive maneuvers. Any class ability that gives defense bonuses reliant upon a held weapon are not applicable when wielding this. In addition, a wielder possessing no inner qi cannot wield this weapon. If the wielder's qi points fall to 0, the weapon becomes inert, and all shards fall to the ground.

### Fluid Blade

When attacking a creature with a shield, magical or otherwise, you ignore its bonus to AC.

### Millennium Lance

The wielder spends 1 qi point to reform the Thousand Demon Daggers into an estoc at the beginning of their turn. It now deals 1d10+3 (19/20 ×2) piercing damage, plus 3d8 piercing damage, and has a 15 ft / 4.5 m range. The wielder has disadvantage on any attacks made within 10 ft / 3 m.

### Rain of a Thousand Stars

In lieu of taking the attack action, the wielder may spend 2 qi points to use this ability instead. The wielder disperses the blade, forming a cloud of razor-sharp shrapnel, and launches it toward an enemy. Make a ranged attack roll. On a hit, it deals 10d6 magical piercing damage and the target suffers one of two effects as determined by the wielder:

- The target must make a Strength saving throw vs the qi save DC or fall prone until the start of the wielder's next turn.
- The target must make a Constitution saving throw vs the qi save DC or take an additional 10d6 damage on the wielder's next turn. The wielder cannot attack with the Thousand Demon Daggers until the end of their next turn but may take other actions.

### Thousand Li Slash

Using a full action, the user spends 3 qi points to extend the reach of the blade to 25 ft and perform a devastating slash. The wielder makes one attack roll to hit all creatures within a 25 ft cone. They take the standard weapon damage multiplied by half the wielder's cultivation modifier rounded down.
