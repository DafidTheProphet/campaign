**Weapon (spear), Artifact (Requires Attunement)**

The Spear of Heaven and Earth is a radiant weapon forged from the essence of the sun and the core of the earth. It has a shaft of gleaming gold, and its blade is a shard of pure sunlight, bound in an ethereal, earth-toned aura.

**Statistics**: 1d6 piercing + 3, plus 2d8 radiant damage. It has a range of 10 ft / 3 m. It automatically critically strikes when attacking an object. This weapon cannot be forcibly taken from the wielder. If the wielder drops the weapon, they can call it to their hand at will.

Forged by celestial blacksmiths in the upper planes, the Spear of Heaven and Earth was created to maintain balance between light and darkness, life and death. Imbued with the radiance of the sun and the steadfastness of the earth, it is a formidable weapon against the forces of evil. The spear is sentient and seeks to bring balance and harmony to the world.

### Radiant Blade

The Spear of Heaven and Earth deals an additional 2d8 radiant damage on a hit. This radiant damage increases to 2d8 against undead and fiends.

### Earth's Embrace

When the wielder strikes the ground with the spear and spends 2 qi points, they can create a tremor in a 10 ft radius. All creatures in this area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 + proficiency bonus + the wielder's Wisdom modifier) or be grappled to the ground by tendrils of qi and take 6d8 radiant damage. On a successful save, they take half damage and are not grappled. Those grappled may make a Strength saving throw (Cultivation save DC) or teleport away to end the condition.

### Heaven's Light

By spending 3 qi points, the wielder can channel the spear’s power to create a blinding flash of light. All creatures in a 30 ft cone must make a Constitution saving throw (DC equal to 8 + proficiency bonus + the wielder's Cultivation modifier) or be blinded until the end of the wielder’s next turn and take 8d8 radiant damage. On a successful save, they take half damage and are not blinded.

### Sentience

The Spear of Heaven and Earth is a sentient lawful neutral weapon with an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 18, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.

### Communication

The spear communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common and Celestial. It also has an innate understanding of the natural world and celestial realms.

### Personality

The Spear of Heaven and Earth seeks to bring balance and harmony, preserving the natural order according to fate. It encourages its wielder to act justly and with mercy, particularly against undead and fiends. It disapproves of actions that would harm the natural world or the innocent. If its wielder commits egregious acts of evil or takes actions to disrupt fate, the spear can choose to become dormant until the wielder atones for their actions.
