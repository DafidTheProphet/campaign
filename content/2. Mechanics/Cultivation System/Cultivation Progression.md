## Cultivation Ability Checks
Your cultivation modifier is one of your ability score modifiers as defined by your cultivation path. Your cultivation modifier determines the potency of your qi techniques. The Cultivation/Qi DC of your character is calculated using the following formula: 8 + Cultivation Proficiency + Cultivation Modifier. 

## Body Refinement
As you advance in your cultivation, your constitution becomes more robust. You gain additional hit points per cultivation stage as determined by your cultivation path. Additionally, at the foundation establishment stage, all ability scores are raised to 13 if they were previously lower. 

## Path Techniques
Each cultivation path has their own version of Reforged Martial Body, Path Initiate Technique, Internal Path Technique, External Path Technique, Path Laws, and Dao Culmination. 

## Qinggong

- Spend 1 qi point to gain a fly speed of equal to your cultivation proficiency times 5 (in ft) for 2 rounds.
- Through meditative breathing, you regain part of your inner qi. You gain half your qi points rounded down upon a short rest. Monks regain all qi points during a short rest.

## Qi Intent
- When you acquire this ability at qi condensation stage, any mundane weapon you wield becomes a +1 magical weapon. This bonus increases to +2 and +3 at foundation establishment and core formation stages.  You may apply these bonuses to any weapon. This bonus only applies if you have at least 1 qi point remaining.  

## Qi Enhanced Strikes

- You may spend a qi point to add your cultivation modifier to an attack roll or damage roll. You may spend 2 qi points to add your modifier to both.

## Qi Defense

- When receiving an attack, you may use your reaction and spend a qi point to reduce the damage of the incoming attack by your qi proficiency plus your cultivation modifier.

## Supernatural Speed
- You may attack an additional time when taking the attack action. This stacks with existing extra attack class features.

## Inner Soul
- Upon death, your soul dissociates from your body. Your soul takes the form of a small ghost. By default, you are invisible, but you may choose to reveal yourself.
