Contrary to their Adamantine Fist brethren, the Guiding Palm sect believes in defeating opponents softly. Their techniques revolve around defense and redirecting enemy attacks, instead of excessive force. Their martial arts eschew brute force, for precise technique and patient defenses.

## Reforged Martial Body: Supreme Sanctified Constitution

Your training in internal enlightenment has made your body and mind incredibly resilient to disruptions. 
- You gain resistance to psychic damage.    
- You may add your cultivation modifier to Wisdom saving throws.
- You can use your reaction to redirect an incoming attack a number of times equal to your cultivation proficiency. If a melee attack hits you, you can make an insight (wisdom) check contested by the attacker’s attack roll. On a success, the attack is redirected to another creature within 5 feet of you. You may also choose to redirect the blow into the ground, giving them disadvantage on any attacks made until the end of their current turn, and advantage to any attacking them until the end of their next turn.

## Path Initiate Technique: Harmonious Wave

As an action, spend 1 qi point and make a single melee weapon attack with a sword or an unarmed strike. On a hit, you deal normal damage and can choose one of the following effects:
- Flowing Disarm: The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the target drops one weapon it is holding.
- Redirected Strike: The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target is pushed 10 feet in a direction of your choice and falls prone.
- Calming Touch: Targeting the dantian, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target is charmed by you until the end of your next turn.


## Internal Path Technique: Ethereal Flow

- Enhanced Redirection: When using your reaction to redirect an attack, you may now redirect ranged attacks as well as melee attacks. You may redirect a ranged attack to an enemy within 30ft of you. 

- Mind Over Matter: You can add your cultivation modifier to any saving throw against being charmed or frightened.

- Meditative Focus: While in combat, you gain advantage on all Insight and Perception checks.

## External Path Technique: Interposing Hand

- You spend 4 qi points to manifest a ghostly hand in front of your opponent. For 1 minute, when that foe makes a melee or ranged attack, their attack roll must be greater than your cultivation DC or the attack misses, regardless of the target’s AC. They may use an action to make a contested cultivation check to dispel this construct. You may only have 1 interposing hand active at a time.
