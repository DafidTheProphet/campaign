## Mountain Tempered Physical Body (Reforged Martial Body)

- Your body has been honed through grueling training on Mereth-Mar. You have advantage on acrobatics and athletics checks. In addition, you may use your reaction to add 3 points of AC upon receiving an attack. If their attack misses, you may make an attack of opportunity as a reaction. You may use this ability an amount of times equal to your qi proficiency modifier per day. 

## Plum Blossom Sword (Path Initiate Technique)

- Your elaborate sword technique bewilders and disables your foe. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with a sword. You may spend a qi point to increase your attack roll by your cultivation modifier minus one. If your strike lands, the enemy has a penalty to their attack roll equal to your cultivation modifier minus one. 

## Internal Path Technique: Windswept Footwork Technique

- Your swiftness on the battlefield lets you weave through enemies without consequence. You gain 10ft of movement speed and cannot provoke attacks of opportunity. 
- If an enemy makes an opportunity attack against an ally within 10ft, you may make an attack of opportunity against that enemy. If your attack lands, the enemy receives a penalty to their attack roll equal to your cultivation modifier. 
- In addition, you may channel your speed to inflict extra damage. You gain a damage bonus on your next attack as defined by the following formula. y = x^(⅔), where x is the distance between your initial position and where you make your attack, and y is the damage bonus (rounded down)

## External Path Technique: 24 Plum Blossom Sword

- As you swing your sword, your qi generates razor-sharp plum blossoms in the air around you. Upon making an attack, you may spend 4 qi points to create an aura that manifests in a 15ft radius from you. Enemies that either start their turn within the aura or move within the aura must make a dexterity saving throw or take 6d6 slashing damage. Upon a success, they take half damage.
