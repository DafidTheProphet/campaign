Contrary to their Guiding Palm brethren, the Adamantine Fist sect has a very direct outlook on martial arts. The path of the Adamantine fist emphasizes brute force and durability to defeat their foes. Their martial arts eschew complicated maneuvers for maximum power.

## Reforged Martial Body: Immovable Physique

Your body is hardened through intense training, granting you an impenetrable physique. 
- You may reduce any incoming slashing, piercing or bludgeoning damage by your cultivation proficiency -1. 
- You gain a +2 bonus to AC.
- Your unarmed strikes deal an additional 1d4 bludgeoning damage.

## Path Initiate Technique: Dantian Fracture

- As an action, spend 1 qi point to strike directly at their dantian with a devastating impact. On a hit, you deal normal unarmed strike damage plus an additional 2d6 force damage. The target must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your cultivation modifier). On a failure, the target is dazed until the end of your next turn. When attacking a non-cultivator, they only suffer half the additional damage and no additional effects.

## Internal Path Technique: Immovable Object

- Indomitable Endurance: You can add your cultivation modifier to Constitution saving throws.
- Unbreakable: Once per short rest, when you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead.

## External Path Technique: Unstoppable Force

- As an action, you spend 5 qi points to blast an enemy with the power of your qi. The enemy must make a DEX save versus your cultivation DC or suffer 8d12 force damage and be hurled 100ft away from you, falling prone. If the enemy hits a wall, they suffer additional bludgeoning damage depending on the properties of the wall (DM discretion). Upon a successful save, they take half damage, are only launched 15 feet, and do not fall prone.
