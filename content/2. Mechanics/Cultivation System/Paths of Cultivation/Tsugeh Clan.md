## Reforged Martial Body: Supreme Sapphire Mind

- Your mental resilience is unmatched. You may add your cultivation modifier to WIS or INT saving throws, and you cannot be charmed.
- As a reaction, you may spend a qi point impose an attack roll penalty equal to your cultivation modifier on a creature attacking you or an ally.Â 
- You have proficiency in investigation if you do not have it already. If you already have proficiency in investigation, you gain expertise instead.


## Initiate Path Technique: Interdicting Talisman Array

- As an action, you may spend 2 qi points to lay a trap below your feet. To detect the trap, the target may make a perception or arcana check versus your qi save dc. Any enemy who walks within 5ft of this trap must make a DEX save (Qi DC) or be paralyzed for 5 turns. The target may use an action to attempt a STR saving throw vs. Qi DC each turn to escape. The trap is active until it dissipates. 

## Internal Path Technique: Eyes of Diamond Clarity

- You gain the ability to see through illusions and magical darkness as if they were not present, providing you with true sight up to 30 feet.

- Your sharp mind allows you to react swiftly to threats. You gain a bonus action on each of your turns that you can use to take the Search or Use an Object action.

- You can cast Detect Thoughts at will without expending a spell slot, using your cultivation save DC. Additionally, when you use this ability, you can also impose disadvantage on the target's Wisdom saving throws against your spells and abilities for the next minute.

## External Path Technique:  Heaven and Earth Divine Net Formation

- Using an action and spending 3 qi points, you disperse your qi to trap enemies and foes alike. All entities within a 60 foot radius are unable to leave the area. In addition, enemies have their movement speed halved and suffer a -2 AC penalty. Allies gain 10ft of movement speed and +2 AC. This lasts until the caster is incapacitated.
