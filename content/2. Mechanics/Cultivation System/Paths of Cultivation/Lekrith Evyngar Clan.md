## Reforged Martial Body: Hundred Poisons Constitution

- You are resistant to poison damage and have advantage on saves vs poison. 
- Your blood acts as a poison. When subjected to this poison, a creature must make a DC 14 CON save or have their movement speed halved and take 2d6 poison damage per turn for ten turns. The target may attempt a saving throw every subsequent turn. You may cut yourself to coat a weapon in blood as a bonus action (receiving 1d4 slashing damage).

## Path Initiate Technique: Nine Earthly Hidden Weapons

- As an action, you may throw a number of darts equal to your cultivation modifier at targets of your choosing. Make a single roll for all projectiles. If you have not taken this action on your turn, you may use your bonus action to throw one dart. You may dip darts in poisons you possess as a free action. This includes cutting yourself to use your blood poison.

## Internal Path Technique: Thousand Poisons Constitution
The poisons in your body has been further refined by intensive cultivation. 

- You subtract your cultivation modifier from any poison damage you receive. 
- In addition, your blood poison becomes more potent. It now deals 4d6 poison damage per turn and the save DC increases to 16. 
- You may elect to deal acid damage instead of poison damage when using your blood poison. If you choose to do so, the enemy does not suffer a movement speed penalty on a failed saving throw.
