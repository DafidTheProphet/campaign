## Reforged Martial Body: Enthralling Presence

- Your presence exudes an aura of charm and allure. You gain proficiency in Charisma checks.
- You can add your Cultivation modifier to Deception, Persuasion, and Stealth checks.
- You can use your charm to impose disadvantage on a creature's attack roll against you as a reaction. You may use this ability a number of times per day equal to your cultivation proficiency.

## Initial Path Technique: Beguiling Melody

- As an action, spend 1 qi point to weave a mesmerizing melody that affects creatures within 30 feet of you. Each creature of your choice that can hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier).
- On a failed save, a target is beguiled by you for 1 minute or until it takes damage. While beguiled in this way, you can use a bonus action to force the creature to move 15ft in any direction, provided it does not lead to direct harm (off a cliff, provoking an opportunity attack, etc).
- Creatures that are immune to charm are also immune to beguiled. Creatures that have advantage against charmed effects also apply this to beguiled saving throws.
- You gain 10 feet of movement whenever a creature fails its saving throw.

## Internal Path Technique: Intrinsic Allure

- Enemies within 10 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) at the start of their turn. On a failed save, they are charmed by you until the end of their turn. This effect ends if the creature takes damage from you or your allies. Once a creature has been affected by this ability, it is immune to it for 24 hours.
- If an enemy is immune to charm, they instead receive a saving throw penalty equal to your cultivation modifier if they fail a cultivation saving throw that would otherwise charm them.Â 
- Any entities you have charmed are also beguiled (see above).
