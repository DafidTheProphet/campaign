- You sacrifice your defenses and inner well-being to inflict the maximum amount of damage on your enemies. 
    
- Until you reach core formation, your lifespan decreases as you cultivate. Upon reaching Qi refinement, your lifespan reduces by 10 years. It reduces by an additional ten years as you advance to Qi condensation and Foundation establishment. 
    
- You may use your reaction a number of times equal to your proficiency modifier to pre-emptively strike an attacker. When an enemy attacks you, you immediately respond with a counter-attack. If your attack lands, the enemy must make their own attack with disadvantage. If your attack doesn’t land, the enemy makes their attack with advantage.
    
- Additionally, any temporary hit points you acquire are converted to a necrotic damage bonus added to a weapon attack. This bonus disappears upon landing a successful attack. 
    
- Your cult’s reputation grants you advantage on intimidation checks, but disadvantage on persuasion checks.**
