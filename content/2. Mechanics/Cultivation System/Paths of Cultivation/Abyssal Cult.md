## Reforged Martial Body: Unhindered Destruction Constitution

You sacrifice your defenses and inner well-being to inflict the maximum amount of damage on your enemies.   
- Until you reach core formation, your lifespan decreases as you cultivate. Upon reaching Qi refinement, your lifespan reduces by 10 years. It reduces by an additional ten years as you advance to Qi condensation and Foundation establishment. You do not gain the lifespan bonuses at these stages. 
- You may use your reaction a number of times equal to your proficiency modifier to pre-emptively strike an attacker. When an enemy attacks you, you immediately respond with a counter-attack. If your attack lands, the enemy must make their own attack with disadvantage. If your attack doesn’t land, the enemy makes their attack with advantage.
- Additionally, any temporary hit points you acquire are converted to a necrotic damage bonus added to a weapon attack. This bonus disappears upon landing a successful attack. 
- Your cult’s reputation grants you advantage on intimidation checks, but disadvantage on persuasion checks.

## Path Initiate Technique: Vitality Harvest

- Spend a qi point to make a single melee weapon attack against a creature, adding your cultivation modifier to the attack and damage rolls. On a hit, the target takes normal weapon damage, and you regain hit points equal to your cultivation proficiency bonus. Additionally, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or suffer from a lingering effect:
	- If the target fails the saving throw, it gains vulnerability to necrotic damage until the end of your next turn, as its life force is destabilized.
	- If the target succeeds on the saving throw, it resists the necrotic influence, avoiding the vulnerability effect.

## Internal Path Technique: Sacrificial Demonic Foundation

- Abyssal Surge: You can expend a hit die to add your hit die roll plus your cultivation modifier to the damage of your next weapon attack. This damage is necrotic. You may only use this ability once per turn. 
- When you use vitality harvest, you also gain temporary hit points equal to your cultivation proficiency (which are converted). 
- Life Drain: Whenever you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to regain hit points equal to your cultivation modifier + your proficiency bonus.
